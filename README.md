# Shepherd

An AWS Lambda function that is triggered on a SNS message from a DynamoDB event. 
This function processes the platemaps that are generated by [Atlas](https://github.com/Kaleido-Biosciences/Atlas)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

#### Environment variables
* During local development, please add a .env file that contains the following properties:

KAPTURE_SERVER=localhost:8080
KAPTURE_USERNAME=your_user_name
KAPTURE_PASSWORD=your_password

* During deployment, create the lambda function with the --environment attribute
  ```
  aws lambda create-function \
      --region us-east-1 \
      --function-name publishPlateMapSetUp \
      --zip-file fileb://publishPlateMapSetUp.zip \
      --role arn:aws:iam::001507046168:role/service-role/DynamoDBKickingLambdaRole \
      --handler publishPlateMapSetUp.handler \
      --timeout 5 \
      --runtime nodejs10.x \
      --environment Variables="{KAPTURE_PASSWORD=replace_with_a_valid_password, \
      KAPTURE_USERNAME=username, KAPTURE_SERVER=localhost:8080 }" 
  ```


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### To start the lambda function
  - npm install
  - npm start

If you are using Webstorm, you can also run and debug the lambda function with the following configuration
```
Name:                   publishPlateMapSetUp.js
Node interpreter:       Project node(~/.nvm/versions/node/v10.15.0/bin/node)
Working directort:      ~/WebstormProjects/shepherd
JavaScript file:        node_modules/bespoken-tools/bin/bst-proxy.js
Application parameters: lambda publishPlateMapSetUp.js --verbose

```

### Testing during development
The Lambda function can be tested locally by running ./test_dev.sh in Terminal.
